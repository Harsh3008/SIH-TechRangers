Problem Statement ID - 1309
Problem Statement Title - Application Development for monitoring of wool from Farm to fabric
Team Name - TechRangers

The problem statement revolves around the wool sector in India, which faces several challenges and inefficiencies in its value chain. To address these issues and create a comprehensive solution, a web application is proposed with the following features:

Wool Market Information:

The wool market in India lacks real-time information on prices, trends, and news. This information gap makes it difficult for wool producers to make informed decisions about when and where to sell their wool.

Wool Tracking:

There is a need for a system that allows wool producers to monitor and track their wool from the farm to the market. This tracking ensures transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain.

Quality Assurance:

Ensuring the quality of wool is crucial for both producers and buyers. However, there is currently no standardized platform for wool grading and quality assurance, leading to inconsistencies in wool quality.

Wool Storage and Warehousing:

Many farmers lack proper facilities for storing and managing their wool inventory. Proper storage is essential to prevent damage and maintain the quality of wool.

Wool Processing:

Access to wool processing services such as shearing, sorting, and dyeing is limited. This restricts the ability of wool producers to add value to their products and meet the specific needs of buyers.

Wool Trading Platform:

The existing wool trading system in India may involve intermediaries, resulting in higher costs and reduced transparency. A direct trading platform would enable producers to connect with buyers more efficiently.



Online Wool Marketplace:

Wool producers often face challenges in finding buyers for their wool. An online marketplace would allow them to showcase their wool directly to potential buyers, expanding their market reach.

Wool Education and Training:

Many wool producers and artisans lack access to educational resources and training opportunities. This limits their ability to improve production techniques, quality standards, design, and marketing skills.

In summary, the wool sector in India is hindered by a lack of information, infrastructure, and access to services. The proposed app-based solution aims to address these issues by providing real-time market information, tracking capabilities, quality assurance, storage and processing support, a direct trading platform, an online marketplace, and educational resources. By doing so, it seeks to empower wool producers and artisans, enhance the quality of wool products, and create a more efficient and transparent wool supply chain in India.
